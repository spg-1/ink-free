I recently read an article on Economist about the current state of Oscars in 2021 and how the viewership has been changing, decreasing over the last few years. 
When I was kid, I got to watch TV for around 1hr a day. I could watch anything - Cartoons, Sports, WWE/WWF and Music Videos were my thing. Watching MTV back then, you could 
see how the culture was changing and the direction it was taking. It was amazing. Later towards the college days, it was less MTV but more about Movies and TV shows - crime thrillers, sitcoms and
other documentaries. We used to go through hoops to watch the Oscars, the Emmys and other award shows. This was the thing. 
Fast forward to 2021, I dont even know when we had Emmys this year or if we had it. Same thing with the Oscars. Somehow the charm is no more. 

The economist article's title was very apt to how I'm feeling about the award shows these days. The title reads - "And the winner is…who cares?"
And I'm not alone in feeling this way. The viewership of Emmys fell to a measly 6.4M in 2020. Definitely Covid-19 played a role in this but it looks like 
there is a cultural shit that is happening in the entertainment world. 
To increase viewership, Oscars has been trying to jazz it up by including different award segments and specicial performances. This has helped but only a bit. 

The upshot is that we are moving away from monoculture epitomized by Oscars, Emmys etc has now been broken into many multicultures. The Econoist says - 
_“We’re in an asynchronous world, where what can be a summer hit show or song to us, nobody else might have heard of or watched,” says Mark Mulligan of midia Research, a consultancy. As for arts prizes, “with every year that goes by, there’s a larger share of the audience for whom they mean much less.” How relevant are the Grammys to a listener who has been led down an algorithmic rabbit-hole into an obsession with sea shanties? Why would someone tune in to the Emmys if their favourite screen idol is an ineligible TikTok star like Charli d’Amelio? (Look her up—or ask a teenager.)_

Well the algorithms are taking up most of our attention and is very clearly visible.

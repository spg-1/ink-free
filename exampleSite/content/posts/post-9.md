I recently read an article on Economist about the current state of Oscars in 2021 and how the viewership has been changing, decreasing over the last few years. 
When I was kid, I got to watch TV for around 1hr a day. I could watch anything - Cartoons, Sports, WWE/WWF and Music Videos were my thing. Watching MTV back then, you could 
see how the culture was changing and the direction it was taking. It was amazing. Later towards the college days, it was less MTV but more about Movies and TV shows - crime thrillers, sitcoms and
other documentaries. We used to go through hoops to watch the Oscars, the Emmys and other award shows. This was the thing. 
Fast forward to 2021, I dont even know when we had Emmys this year or if we had it. Same thing with the Oscars. Somehow the charm is no more. 

The economist article's title was very apt to how I'm feeling about the award shows these days. The title reads - "And the winner isâ€¦who cares?"
And I'm not alone in feeling this way. The viewership of Emmys fell to a measly 6.4M in 2020. Definitely Covid-19 played a role in this but it looks like 
there is a cultural shit that is happening in the entertainment world.
